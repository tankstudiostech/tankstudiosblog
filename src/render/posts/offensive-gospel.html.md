<h3>The Gospel is Offensive</h3>
<p>
	Recently I told a story about my car getting fixed.  In that story, I mentioned sharing the gospel with the mechanic.
	In our conversation, the mechanic told he has no interest in following Jesus.  He does not even believe Jesus even
	walked the Earth!  However, he explained to me how he enjoys hearing messages from a certain well-known preacher.
</p>

<p>
	I have given much thought to his statement.  It is confusing.  What about the gospel could a person
	who completely rejects the Godhood and Lordship of Christ enjoy?  I have decided that such a person
	must not have heard the true gospel.
</p>

<h3>The Offenses</h3>
<p>
	Paul claims that in sharing the knowledge of Christ, "we are the aroma of Christ in God both to those who are being saved
	and those who are perishing to one a fragrance from death to death, to the other a fragrance from life to life." 2 Cor. 2:16.
	When we explain the gospel of Christ, we should share the gospel in love, but people will not always love it.
	Please join me in Romans 5 as I explain why
</p>

<h4>We Exist because God Allows It</h4>
<p>
	"For while we were still weak, at the right time, Christ died for the ungodly" Rom. 5:6.
</p>
<p>
	We want to be dependent.  We can do it on our own!  We are strong, smart, dependent, confident!
	The gospel explains that we are weak.  In fact, Rev:11 says we would immediately stop existing if Jesus decided it.
	He could also stop letting our heart beat or giving us air to breath.
	This offends our pride in our dependency.
</p>
<h4>We have Rebelled</h4>
<p>
	"God shows His love for us in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us." Rom 5:8 
</p>
<p>
	We want to be blameless.  We have done nothing wrongQ  Morality is not absolute!
	The gospel explains that we have broken God's law.  That we are "by nature children of wrath" (Eph 2:3).
	That there is no one good, not even one (Ps. 14:3).  This offends our desire to be free of blame.
</p>
<h4>We will be Condemned</h4>
<p>
	"Since therefore we have been justified by His blood, much more shall we be saved by Him from
	the wrath of God." Rom. 5:9.
</p>
<p>
	We want to be free of responsibility.  We have no reason to be punished!  Surely we have been good enough!
	The gospel explains that we will be condemned for our rebellion against our Creator.  Murdering only once
	brands us as a murderer, deserving punishment.  Breaking God's law (sinning) only once brands us a sinner, and
	we have all sinned and fall short of the glory of God (Rom 3:23).  God is just, vengeance is His, He will repay (Deut 32:35).
	This offends our desire to be free of responsibility for our evil.
</p>
<h4>We are not as Good as Jesus</h4>
<p>
	"For as by one man's disobedience (Adam) the many (us) were made sinners, so by one man's obedience (Jesus)
	the many will be made righteous." Rom. 5:19
</p>

<p>
	We want to be the best.  We are unique!  There is no one like us!
	The gospel explains that Jesus lived a perfect life.  As shown above, every single one of us falls short,
	but Jesus did not because Jesus is fully man and fully God (Jn 1:1, Jn 8:58, Jn 20:28 to name a small few).
	We do not measure up to Jesus.  We do not even get close.  This offends our pride.
</p>
<h4>We Cannot Save Ourselves</h4>
<p>
	"For if while we were enemies we were reconciled to God by the death of His Son, much more, now that
	we are reconciled, shall we be saved by His life." Rom 5:10
</p>

<p>
	We want to be good enough on our own.  We are powerful!  We can protect ourselves and those we care about!
	The gospel explains, as stated earlier, we have all sinned and are will have God's wrath poured out on us. We can do
	nothing to prevent that.  But Jesus did!  While we were DEAD in our sins, we were saved by grace
	through faith in Jesus Christ, not by works so that none may boast (Eph 2:8).  Praise Jesus for doing
	what none of us could do!  He lived a perfect life, and
	God made Him who knew no sin to be sin on our behalf so that in Him
	we might become the righteousness of God (2 Cor 5:21).  By believing in Him we are legally made
	not guilty in the sight of God!  This offends our belief that we can save ourselves.
</p>
<h4>We Must Follow Jesus as Lord</h4>
<p>
	"More than that, we also rejoice in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received
	reconciliation." Rom 5:11
</p>

<p>
	We do not want to submit to anyone.  We live our own life! We need follow nobody!
	We want to live a life where we simply eat, drink, and be merry (1 Cor 15:32).  Jesus, being God in flesh
	(1 Tim. 3:16), demands our obedience.  When we believe in Him, we accept Him as Lord of our life.
	We are made a new creation (2 Cor 5:17), our sin crucified with Him on the cross, us buried with Him in death, and us
	risen to walk with Him in His resurrection to life (Rom 6:4).  Living lives our own way shows we have no love
	for Him and that we have never been justified and made new.  This offends our desire to be our own authority.
</p>

<h3>Conclusion - Jesus is Life</h3>
<p>
	I hope you see how this message is offensive to those who do not believe.  If there is no love for Jesus,
	nobody can find any of the above to be the "good news" believers know it to be.  When we as believers
	preach the gospel, we must preach it this way. Any other message will not save.  The gospel is the power
	of God for salvation to those who believe (Rom 1:16), but if anybody preaches any other gospel,
	they will be accursed (Gal 1:8).
</p>

<p>
	If you do not follow Jesus as Lord, I BEG you on behalf of Jesus Christ, be reconciled to God!
	God made Him who knew no sin to be sin on YOUR behalf so that in Jesus you might become the
	righteousness of God (2 Cor 5:21).  Please believe.  Jesus came that we may have life and life in
	abundance (Jn 10:10).  He is the best master to have.  Go to Him, for He gives rest,
	His yoke is easy and His burden is light (Matt 11:28-30).
