<h3>Car Problems</h3>
<p>**The Tankersley family seems to be cursed with car troubles.**  One man even wanted to write a book 
about our many difficulties.  He claimed he would never run out of content. Discovering my car has another 
problem is about as common as waking up to a shiny, new pimple on my face.  It happens enough to not be
surprising, but I wish I could just make it go away for good.</p>

<p>**Recently, a metaphorical pimple manifested in a most inconvenient way.**</p>

<h3>Locked Door</h3>
<p>**My car door lock had been finicky.  It was refusing to accept my key as the proper key.**  I always managed it, but
eventually I took it into a Honda dealer.  They fixed it...for a week.  It once again began to be finicky.</p>

<p>I decided to stop locking my front door.  I would every other door, just not the front.  My car helped me accomplish this plan
in that the automatic lock would lock all but the front door.</p>

<p>**Or so I thought...**</p>

<p>Pulling up to my office, I get out of the car and close the door.  Remembering I need to lock all but the
front door, I open the door again, hit the lock button, and let gravity close the door for me.</p>

<p>As it shuts, I suddenly realize that my car has betrayed me; **it locked all 4 doors!**  My mad attempt
to stick my fingers in the door before gravity finishes the dirty deed left me only with a jammed finger
and the bitter taste of defeat.<p>
<p>I decide to deal with it later, but as I walk towards my office, I realize my phone is still in the car.
Not sure how long I have until phone withdrawal kicks in, I turn around and spend the next fifteen minutes,
key in the door, twisting, jamming, and begging.  **Finally, I head into my office with no success**</p>

<p>My wife is kind enought to pick me up at the end of the day.  We try her key to no avail.  I plan to try
again the next day.  If I cannot get the key into the door, I will call a person to pop the lock open for
me and then bring the car back to the dealership.</p>

<h3>Pop-A-Lock</h3>

<p>**At lunch the next day, I head to my car in prayer.**  "Father, it would be wonderful if You opened this door
for me.  I know You can.  It would save me $50 bucks and the headache of having people come out
to open it.  So why not?  This is my last chance.  If You don't, I'll go call Pop-A-Lock to open it.
I trust Your plan and will."</p>

<p>Expecting a miracle, I continue jiggling the key, again to no avail.  **Dejected, I call the Pop-A-Lock guy.**
He comes and pops the lock open in roughly 30 seconds, completely shaking my confidence
that my locked car is actually safe.  **I then open the door...and the car enters panic mode**.</p>

<p>"No worries" the Pop-A-Lock man says, "just get the key and use it on the front door."  I had not yet
explained to him that my front door is actually the problem!  The horn dies down after about 5 minutes, but
reopening a door or starting the ignition causes it to flare upa ll over again.  We set the alarm off
three times trying to solve the problem.  I am now the favorite person of all the businesses in the area.</p>

<p>The Pop-A-Lock man gives up, but he tells me that he will wave the $45 fee of popping the lock, and they will
send a new guy out to replace my entire lock!  Thanking him, I turn to go inside...until I once again realize
my phone is still in the car.  I prepare myself for the hatred of all around me, open the door, grab my phone,
and walk away as my car repeatedly cries out its panicked alarm<p>

<h3>The Repair</h3>
<p>A few hours later, a man comes to repair the door.  As he is repairing the door, we get to chat for about an hour.
In that time, I get the opportunity to tell him about following Jesus and invite him to my church!</p> 

<p>Once he fixes the lock, I ask him if I can get a remote key for keyless entry.  He tells me he can get that for me at no extra cost!
For $130, I get a guy to pop my car lock, then another guy to replace my door lock, and then finally they make a third
trip out to give me a remote entry key!  That is at least a $300 value at a dealership. If God had answered
my request to have the door opened, it would have cost me a couple extra bucks, I would have been without
a car for a few days, and I wouldn't have gotten to share the gospel.  I'm glad He followed His plan rather
than answering the my request in the way I asked.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p> In Philippians, Paul tells us to be anxious for nothing, but instead make our requests to God, and 
His peace that surpasses all understanding will guard our hearts.  Sometimes we see God work things out in an awesome way like above that makes us
cheer easily.  Sometimes we are left at the end of the day still wondering why God didn't answer our request
the way we expected Him to answer.</p>

<p>Paul doesn't tell us He always will.  Paul just tells us that
we can have peace knowing that God has heard our request and will work all things together for good to
those who love Him and are called according to His purpose.  Obediently trusting Him in that way will
give us peace and lead us closer to Jesus, and Jesus is worth more than time, money, and any
other created thing.</p>

<p>So today, determine what is making you anxious, make your request about it to God, and trust that He
will work it out in a way that leads the most people to His Son.  If that doesn't sound like an
appealing result, please seek to understand how Christains can say, "I count all things as rubbish compared
to the joy of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord."</p>
