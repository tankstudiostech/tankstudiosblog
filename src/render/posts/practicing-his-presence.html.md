    The Practice of the Presence of God is short, simple, and effective.
</p>

<p>
    On its length, I could have read the entire book in an hour and
    half or less. It is a collection of letters written by Brother
    Lawrence, recounted conversations with him, and it ends with a
    brief story of his life.
</p>

<p>
    It is so short because it is so simple. There is no need to
    delve into many different aspects of the topic. The message is
    this: Practice the Presence of God. No matter what you are doing or
    where you are, God is there with you. Never forget that. Constantly
    practice the recognition that He is near and be in constant
    communication with Him. Simply open yourself up to His presence
    and feel His love for you and pour out your love and thanksgiving
    to Him. Each task should be done out of love for Him.
</p>

<p>
    Finally, the simplicity of the topic also makes it greatly
    effective. Despite the book being so short, I took two weeks to
    read it, and I'm glad I did. I need that simple reminder said to
    me over and over in different ways. It is so easy to forget the
    presence of God. We may study Him, think about Him, talk about Him,
    but never remember simply that He is with us at every moment. It
    is so easy to get caught up in our daily tasks and forget His
    presence in our life throughout the entire day.

    Thank you Jesus for giving us Your righteousness, allowing
    us to know and be known by God!
