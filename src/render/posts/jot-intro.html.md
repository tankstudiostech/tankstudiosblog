<p>
	The Old Testament (OT) is an interesting set of books.  I bet it is safe to assume most Christians have not read the OT entirely.
	It is definitely safe to assume most Christians know and understand the New Testament (NT) better than the OT; I am among that group.
	And finally, some Christians, perhaps, only find benefit in the added weight to the hardcover book, using it as a holy paperweight and gaining arm strength lugging it around everywhere.
</p>

<p>
	However, there is an amazing depth in the OT when read understanding its purpose.  I hope to explain that purpose, and, in each further post in this series, explain
	an OT story and show how it meets that purpose.
</p>

<h3>What is the OT?</h3>
<p>
	Before delving into the purpose, lets briefly discuss what the OT is.  The OT is a series of books outlining the history of the Jewish nation and their interaction with God.
	There are several different series that were written in similar ways with a similar mindset.  The series are as follows	
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Books of the Law - Tells the story of creation, shows God choosing the Israelites, details them reaching the land He promises them (modern day Israel), and lists out
	the laws God gives them to follow, starting with the Ten Commandments</li>
	<li>Books of History - Tells the story of the Israelites taking over the Promised Land and their ups and downs in following the laws of God up through around 400 B.C.</li>
	<li>Books of Wisdom - Explains life proverbs, discusses the meaning of life, and contains prayers and songs of individuals to God</li>
	<li>Major Prophets -  Contains !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
	<li>Minor Prophets - Contains !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
</ul>

<h3>What is the Purpose of the OT?</h3>
<p>
	Now knowing what the OT contains, lets talk about why it was written.  Paul says that all Scripture is God-breathed and useful (1 Tim. 3:16-17).
	In Jesus' time, the Jews held the OT in high esteem.  They strictly followed the laws and sacrifices
	listed in the book of the Law.  The sang the Psalms and searched out the meanings of the prophets. In fact, as children, Jews were required to memorize the Books of the Law
	(Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy), and many would memorize the entire OT! (citation needed)  They believed their salvation into eternal life
	rested within the scriptures.
</p>

<h3>Jesus' Explanation</h3>
<p>
	And they were correct!  But many did not understand it.	Jesus Himself calls them out and explains how they have completely missed the purpose.
</p>

<p>
	In John 5, the Pharisees, the people who supposedly knew the law best of the Jews, come to Jesus and asking who testifies with Him that
	He is the Christ.  Jesus tells them that John the Baptist testifies (Jn 1:29), Jesus' works of the Father testify (...all 4 gospels), and finally that the entire OT testifies:
	>"You search the Scriptures because you think that in them you have eternal life; and it is they that bear witness about me, yet you refuse to come to me that you may have life...
	Do not think that I will accuse you to the Father.  There is one who accuses you: Moses, on whom you have set your hope.  For if you believed Moses, you would believe
	Me; for He wrote of me." (Jn 5:38-46)
</p>

<p>
	The Pharisees memorized the entire OT, but when Jesus came, they rejected Him!  Jesus tells them that if they truly believed what they were reading,
	they would not be rejecting Jesus; they would be worshipping Him!	
</p>

<p>
	So we see, the OT does point to eternal life because in its entirety -- every single letter -- it points to Jesus.  It details how we fall short of the glory of God,
	fail in our role as His image bearers, and desperately need a Savior.  It explains that from our failures we have earned the wrath of God, and that just
	as a murderer has to pay the penalty for breaking the law, we also must pay the penalty for rebelling against our Creator.  And finally, it points to the One
	who will come to save us -- that He will come, bear the wrath of God in our place, give us the chance to have His right standing before God, and reign as Lord over all.
	For a fuller picture of this, please read <a style="color: cornflowerblue;" title="The Offensive Gospel" href="/posts/offensive-gospel.html">this explanation
	of the Gospel from Romans 5</a>.
</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>
	I hope this post has excited you to see all the ways the OT points to Jesus.  Understanding this concept has deepened my love for the OT, and it always excites me
	when I find in it another picture of what Christ has done for us.  God always comes up with the best symbolism and parables.
