<blockquote>
	<p>
		[He is] imagining that godliness is a means of gain. But godliness 
		with contentment is great gain, for we brought nothing into the world, 
		and we cannot take anything out of the world. - 1 Tim 6:5-7
	</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
	When previously I heard and read that verse, I
	never understood it.  When I considered the meaning, I would
	try to figure out what godliness gains.  Godliness gains much!
	For example, living a godly life brings joy in knowing we are pleasing the
	One we were made to please.  **However, thinking just on that question
	misses the context of the passage.**
</p>

<h3>An End, not a Means</h3>

<p>
	Looking before verse 6, we see Paul describing false teachers.
	These teachers use half-truths based on the gospel to sway
	the church members into following. This gains the teachers
	money, popularity, and power.  They avoid the
	<a href="offensive-gospel.html">offensive
	teachings of the gospel</a> and overexaggerate what people want to hear.
</p>

<p>
	If your gospel says, "Follow Jesus, and you will have everything the
	world wants but keeps failing to get: money, power, success, health",
	take some time to consider your gospel; it's not the gospel
	Jesus brought.  The world is broken. **Jesus
	did not come so that we could look like what the world glorifies.** But
	we become the weak to shame the strong, the foolish to shame the wise, and those
	who are not to bring to nothing those that are (1 Cor 1:26-30).
</p>

<p>
	Paul here is saying that godliness is not a means to an end.  These false
	teachers are "leading" people to their own version of godliness, and this
	version glorifies the creation rather than the Creator.  **The godliness
	that the people pursue is just a means to get some gain.**
</p>

<p>
	Paul corrects that thought.  Godliness is not a *means* of gain;
	godliness, with contentment, *is* great gain!  **We should not be pursuing
	godliness so we can find our own personal gain, we should be pursuing 
	godliness as the gain.**
</p>

<p>
	Therefore trying to determine what gain godliness brings is completely
	missing the point.  Godliness *is* the great gain.
</p>

<h3>A Mindset Change</h3>

<p>
	Godliness, put simply, is the way our life pleases God. Paul says
	"This is my aim, whether at home or away, to be pleasing to Him" (2 Cor 5:10).
	We are made a new creation by faith in Jesus, and those who follow Him are
	loved and are made righteous, no longer to receive eternal wrath for disobedience.
	The love of God is unconditional and forever.
	But a parent can have unconditional love for a child
	and still at times receive great joy from the child and at others receive
	great grief.  **Godliness is a lifestyle that brings our Father great
	joy.**
</p>
<p>
	So how does living with the mindset of godliness
	being the end, being the great gain, affect my life?  It simplifies
	it!  We can look at everything as a means to the end of godliness.
	**If godliness is truly our end, our great gain,
	we simply ask a question over every aspect of our life:
	"Will this lead to godliness?"**
</p>

<p>
	Does my job lead to godliness?  How can I use this money to gain
	godliness?  I love my wife; how can I encourage her to gain godliness?
	My friend and I are going to hang out; what can I do or discuss
	in order to help us both gain godliness?  There is a stranger over there;
	can I do anything for him so that he can gain godliness?
</p>

<p>
	**When seeing godliness as great gain, our time with Jesus becomes
	precious.**  Time spent worshipping our Savior - reading
	and meditating on His Words, praying to Him, singing praise, etc -
	transforms us by the renewing of our mind to know
	the will of God: that which is good and acceptable and perfect 
	(Rom. 12:1-2).  That is godliness!  **We go to Jesus, the only
	one who can satisfy our souls, to get godliness, the only end
	that is truly gain.**
</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>
	I hope you see the beauty in pursuing godliness as an end rather than
	a means. **Pursue with me and encourage others to pursue also.**
</p>

<p>
	Also, I would like to thank Sean Fuentes for a great Bible study that
	started this thought process and Clinton Fields for a helpful
	insights on it later.
