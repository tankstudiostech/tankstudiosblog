<p>
    I am weak, and I'm not referring to my physical strength. Okay, to be fair, I can include my physical strength in that weakness.
    I put all my effort into running instead of strength. So assuming I have a slight head start on the strong guy who wants to beat
    in my face, I should be fine.
</p>
<p>
    Lets start over. I am weak. I am weak physically, but I am also weak in other aspects of my life. For instance, I am unable to multitask. If
    I am driving a car and simultaneously having an in-depth conversation with the passenger, I will likely end up going home. Why? Home is the
    path of least resistance. My brain cannot have the conversation and make directional decisions, so it just chooses the path which it takes most regularly.
    Michelle often corrects my directions

<p>
    Also, I am a shy, reserved person. Mingling is rough on me. I've found that if you have something in your hands, keep moving, and have a determined look on your face, people
    are less likely to notice that you're just traveling a large circle around the mingling area and not actually talking to anybody. For most of my life, however,
    this caused far greater issues than the occasional mingling event. For instance, my freshman year in college, I went a full week not having a conversation
    with a single person. I holed out in my dorm, in the dark, leaving only for food and classes.  Good times.
</p>
<p>
    And I could go on. I'm not an audial learner. I get extremely grumpy when I am both hungry and bored. I'm not observant. I forget details.
</p>
<p>
    Most people are ashamed, or at least sad, by their weaknesses. However, here I am, happily discussing them with the world. Why would I do that?
</p>
<h3>Where Weakness Comes From</h3>
<p>
    Christians will often declare that weakness is a result of sin. Any physical or mental defficiancies are a result of sin in the world, and they are bad.
    If at all possible, we should try to power through them. If not, suffer with them as best as possible.
</p>
<p>
    But what if, sometimes, weaknesses are from God? Read this:
</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>
        But Moses said to the Lord, "Oh, my Lord, I am not eloquent, either in the past or since you have spoken to your servant, 
        but I am slow of speech and of tongue." Then the Lord said to him, "Who has made man's mouth? Who makes him mute, or deaf, or seeing, or blind? Is it not I, the Lord?"
    </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
    **Exodus 4:10-11**
</p>
<p>
    Wait, what? When I read this, I was stunned. God just declared that HE makes a man mute, deaf, seeing, and blind. Maybe I should look elsewhere...
